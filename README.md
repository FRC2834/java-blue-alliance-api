java-blue-alliance-api
======================

A Java API to access FIRST FRC information from the thebluealliance.com API. Written simply and fully documented.

**Note that this v3 wrapper is still under development, but will soon replace the v2 wrapper. This is because The Blue Alliance will shutdown v2 on January 1st, 2018.**

#Version Information
For simplicity, the API major version (ex. the first number of the version) will always correspond with the API version from the Blue Alliance.
The branches will also represent the *Blue Alliance* API version, so branch v1 represents version one of the Blue Alliance API
This branch is **v3** of the BlueAlliance API
