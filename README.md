java-blue-alliance-api
======================

A Java API to access FIRST FRC information from the thebluealliance.com API. Written simply and fully documented.

**NOTE THAT THIS BRANCH OF THE V2 API IS INCOMPLETE AS WE ARE WAITING FOR THE BLUE ALLIANCE TO FINALIZE THEIR V2 API**

#Version Information
For simplicity, the API major version (ex. the first number of the version) will always correspond with the API version from the Blue Alliance.
The branches will also represent the *Blue Alliance* API version, so branch v1 represents version one of the Blue Alliance API
This branch is **v2** of the BlueAlliance API

#Changelog

* Version 2.0.0
    * Initial Release

#Credits

* The Blue Alliance for the creation of this API, we only created that Java wrapper for it. Thank you!

#Dependencies

* GSON from Google, v 2.2.4 was used for this project, but any new version should work. https://code.google.com/p/google-gson/
